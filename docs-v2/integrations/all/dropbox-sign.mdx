## API gotchas

-   When you create your application in the App Console, youâ€™ll choose from different scopes in the â€˜Permissionsâ€™ tab.
-   There are different scopes depending on the billing model you choose. "Charge users" model provides full access with billing to end users while "Charge me" model offers limited access with billing to app owner.
